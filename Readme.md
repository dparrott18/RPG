The goal of this is to create a toolset of cmdline PowerShell tools that can be used while playing Pathfinder or D&D.
Some guidelines

    1. Local only - Web pages are nice, but running locally means you don't have to worry.
    2. Command line is your friend.  Keep GUI interactions to a minimum unless absolutely necessary.
    3. Try to keep required module use to a minimum for simplicty of installation.\
    4. Allow use of multiple characters/campaigns

Required modules - PSSQLite

I store the files in OneNote for a couple of reasons. It's automatically backed up, there's version control, and it syncs to different computers so I don't have to play at the same computer all the time.  Also, this is currently setup for my campaigns, where the DM charged tax until a certain point in the story, and requires/allows us to sort the coins out as much as possible in the coins we get.  What we cannot evenly separate out can be changed into the lower demonmination.  We also give the "party fund" a full share of the rewards, which we use to buy things like disguises or resurections of party members.
